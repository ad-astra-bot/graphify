    """Re-point dangling in-corpus Perl ``imports`` edges onto the real package node.

    ``use Foo::Bar;`` / ``require Foo::Bar;`` emit an imports edge to a bare
    module-label id (``_make_id('Foo::Bar')``) that matches no node: when Foo::Bar
    is defined in the corpus its package node's id is ``_make_id(stem, 'Foo::Bar')``
    (and a ``package Foo::Bar;`` may live in a file whose stem is unrelated — a
    multi-package file — so we key on the package LABEL, not the file stem). Bridge
    module-label -> real package id so in-corpus imports connect instead of
    dangling. External modules (POSIX, Carp, …) have no in-corpus package node, so
    their edge keeps its bare target — matching the dangling-stub behavior other
    languages leave on unresolved external imports.

    ``perl_source_files`` (absolute-path strings, from ``extract()`` where
    ``_get_extractor(path) is extract_perl``) scopes both the package-node scan and
    the re-pointed edges to Perl provenance. Suffix-based scoping (``.pl``/``.pm``)
    silently skipped extensionless ``#!/usr/bin/perl`` scripts, which are dispatched
    to extract_perl by shebang and whose imports were never re-pointed
    (underreporting). When ``None`` (direct callers), falls back to suffix matching.

    Runs AFTER the shared cross-file call pass (see the resolver registration in
    extract.py): later slices' call binding reads imports targets as bare
    module-label ids, so re-pointing before that would break the binding. Mutates
    ``all_edges`` in place; the bare target was never a node, so there is nothing
    to prune.

    # cached fragment is stored relative and re-anchored on load against the RESOLVED
    # cache root, so its `source_file` comes back as an absolute resolved path that
    # no longer equals the raw provenance string — exact membership then misses and
